Bike Sales Dashboard 

Excel is Amazing
At first, I use Excel only for formulas
I got to discover that I could do amazing things with Excel
Looking at the Bike Sales Dashboard, it gives us an insight on quantity of bike purchased by Gender in different Occupations, Average Income Pre-Purchase and Regions where bikes are purchased.
The dashboard also gives us insight on Martial status, Age group, Commute Distance and Education. You can drill down on each and ever of these categories to know more. Through this interactive visualization and exploration, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of those purchasing the bikes, which will in return inform their decisions on steps to take, that will improve the organization.
